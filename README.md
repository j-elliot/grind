traditional fighting game with a stamina bar that drains with each attack. 

I thought of this while playing Soul Caliber 2 with my family the other day. In nearly every fighting game I've played, it's too easy to make button mashing a legitimate strategy. Nobody likes how effective it can be, and it breaks immersion with its lack of realism. Some games have stamina bars, but this seems to universally be a stamina that builds up as you attack until it is full and allows special attacks. What I want to see is a stamina bar that drains with each attack. It slowly regenerates when you're not attacking, so if you want to go hard, you have to have a plan to fall back and rest between bursts. 

Possiblilities for fine tuning include:
Stamina regenerates fastest when perfectly still
Defending from attacks drains a tiny amount of stamina, so being caught on a defensive from a barage could keep you pinned
Different characters will have different balances of health, speed, power, and stamina, making for more complex strategies
And more!

Plan for development would be following through with a Unity tutorial on creating a fighting game, then once that is working, shoehorning in this mechanic.
